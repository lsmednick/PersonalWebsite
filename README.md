## Description

For this project, I designed a personal website for myself as an audio and software engineer. The main goal I sought out to accomplish was to showcase my education, experience, and projects in a succinct and organized manner. 

The landing page of this site features a header bar that states my name as well as provides navigational buttons for the user to select. The biography is located at the top of the page in order to introduce myself to the user and make clear the intention of the website. This website features two internal links on this header bar, labelled “Portfolio” and “Contact" in order to bring users to these pages on the site. There are multiple external links as well with the most obvious one being the "Resume" button on the header bar. In addition to this, every single image is an external link that brings the user to either a school, company, or project website.

This website features various HTML tables across every page in order to neatly display various pieces of information. Additionally, the site features jQuery fade in animations when loading up the Home, Portfolio, and Contact pages. For further interactivity, each image changes in opacity when hovering over them with a cursor. In order to make this website adaptable on various sized screens, CSS media queries were used in order to neatly resize elements upon screen resizing.
